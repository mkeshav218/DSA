*)How users from same room are sending and receiving the messages?
Ans :- When a user click on "Start Chatting", he starts listening on the event which is 
	roomId of that room.And when he sends any messages then message gets emitted to 
	event which is roomId of that room.This way a user can sends & receive messages
	inside a room.

*)If a user does not join any room, will he be able to receive message?
Ans :- No, A user can't receive any message without joining a room because without joining
	any room, user has not started listening on any event hence user will not receive 
	any message.

*) Will a user from different room can get messages of other room?
Ans :- No, A user from different room can't get messages from other room because the user 
	is not listening on event of the other room.
